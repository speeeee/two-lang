# What is two-lang?

two-lang is an esoteric programming language that aims to be very simple in design.  The main concept of the language is its simple pattern-matching.  The language is technically untyped; literals are instead grouped with their respective type in a list, and pattern-matching can be used to isolate the literal (or type).

# What is the point of two-lang?

None.  This is just a quick project I wanted to do.  This is not much more than a pattern-matching system.  However, a more in-depth look on the language is in DOCS.md.
